    <h2>Cruz Day</h2>
    <p>Hello!</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from birth. The driving force for my testimony is the Love of Christ. I am thankful to the Prophets and Apostles of our day and those of old, for their honorable and selfless service in pursuit of the will of God.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am a full-time student with a major in Cybersecurity. I hope to be able to understand more about computer technology and the potential applications it may present. I would love to be a participant in the pursuit of a greater understanding of the tools God has given to us and see how I can help to use them to make the world a better place.</p>
    <p>I enjoy physical activities, such as skydiving, scuba diving, surfing, and many more. I look forward to getting to know all of my peers. Thank you for taking the time out of your day to observe my web page.</p>
